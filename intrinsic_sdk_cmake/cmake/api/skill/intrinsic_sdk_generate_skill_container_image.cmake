#
# Generate the skill container image.
#
# This container image will build the user's skill in a container and produce
# an archive (.tar) containing the container image.
#
# The process for building the container by default is to:
#
# - start with the ghcr.io/intrinsic-ai/intrinsic_sdk_cmake:latest image
# - copy the contents of the CONTAINER_CONTEXT_DIRECTORY into the image
# - install the dependencies of the package with rosdep install
# - build the user's package with colcon and --packages-up-to $SKILL_PACKAGE
# - restart with ghcr.io/intrinsic-ai/intrinsic_sdk_cmake:latest
# - install exec (run-time) only dependencies with rosdep install
# - copy the install folder of the user's colcon build
# - set up the container to run the SKILL_EXECUTABLE on start
#
# So the CONTAINER_CONTEXT_DIRECTORY needs to contain everything you need to
# build the SKILL_PACKAGE beyond intrinsic_sdk_cmake and what is installed via
# rosdep install.
#
# Note that the skill main executable must be installed to be used in the
# standard skill dockerfile.
#
# This target is not added to ALL by default, since this is an expensive target
# to build and usually only needs to be built when deploying.
# It is recommended to invoke this target manually with cmake using
# `cmake --build <build dir> --target <TARGET>` or with colcon using the
# `colcon build --cmake-target <TARGET> --packages-select <pkg name>` options.
#
# :param TARGET: the name of the target created by this function
# :type TARGET: string
# :param SKILL_EXECUTABLE: the relative path to the skill executable in the
#   install folder
# :type SKILL_EXECUTABLE: string

#   install folder
# :type SKILL_CONFIG: string

# :param CONTAINER_TAG_NAME: the container image's tag name to be given when
#   building the container image, which can be used outside of cmake to
#   interact with, or delete, the container image that is created in this target
# :type CONTAINER_TAG_NAME: string
# :param CONTAINER_CONTEXT_DIRECTORY: the directory to build the container in,
#   which will also be the directory whose contents will be copied into the
#   colcon workspace's src folder inside the container and should contain all
#   the packages that are needed to build the skill package beyond rosdep
#   dependencies.
